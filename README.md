# PokemonGame

This is a Pokemon game project made as a clone to Nintendo's Pokemon game. This project uses a variety of design patterns, Unity assets, Pokemon assets, and etc. to accomplish every detail made in the game. 

### Design patterns
Some design patterns include: Observer design pattern, singleton design pattern. In the future, I am also planning to refactor the battle system to use state machine design pattern. 

### Unity Assets
Some Unity assets include: Dotween, BoxCollider2D, RigidBody2D, etc.

### Pokemon Assets
Some Pokemon assets include the sprites obtained from their websites, and pokemon base stats from bulbapedia. 

### How to install and run the project.
##### Using correct version of Unity
To test out the project, simply install the correct unity version (the one that I used to create this project), which is 2021.3.1f1, then load the project and click the run button in the unity screen. 

##### Method 2
If the correct version cannot be found, install any version of unity, load the project, and try to open it. The Unity Hub will pop up a message asking if you want to open the project using the same version it was created in, click yes, and it will install and open the project in the correct version.
